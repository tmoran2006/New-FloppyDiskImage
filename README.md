# New-FloppyDriveImage
This is a PowerShell module for creating floppy disk images

You will need to create a folder with the same name as the file and add it to your $PSHOME directory.

Once this is complete, restart all instances of PowerShell and the module should show up for you as New-FloppyDiskImage
